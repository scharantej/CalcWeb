In this corrected and validated code:

- The `calculate` function now checks for the division by zero case and handles it gracefully by displaying a meaningful message instead of causing an error.
- The code includes a `main` block that serves as the entry point for the Flask application, ensuring it runs properly when executed directly.

# Validation

This corrected code ensures that all variables used in the HTML files (`index.html` and `result.html`) are referenced correctly in the Python code. It also eliminates the unnecessary `style.css` file reference in the `index.html` file, as no styling is implemented in this application.

# Output

The output of the Assistant's tasks is the corrected and validated Python code provided above, which can be used to run the Flask application and perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
