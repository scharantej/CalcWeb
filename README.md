## A Calculator Website Using Flask

### HTML Files
1. `index.html`:
   - Main page of the application.
   - Contains a form with input fields for the numbers and a submit button to calculate the result.

2. `result.html`:
   - Displays the result of the calculation.
   - Includes the values of the numbers and the calculated result.

### Routes
1. `/`:
   - Serves the `index.html` file.
   - Displays the form for entering numbers.

2. `/calculate`:
   - Receives the submitted form data.
   - Performs the calculation based on the received numbers.
   - Renders the `result.html` file, displaying the calculated result.

### Implementation Details
- The `index.html` file should include a reference to the `style.css` file for any necessary styling.
- The `calculate` route should use the `request` object to access the form data.
- The calculated result should be stored in a variable and passed to the `result.html` template for display.
- Error handling should be implemented to handle cases where invalid input is provided or an unexpected error occurs during the calculation.

## Additional Tips:
- Consider adding a basic level of validation on the client side using JavaScript to handle simple errors before submitting the form.
- Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and report any errors that may occur during the calculation.
- Utilize Flask's built-in templating engine to render the HTML files dynamically, allowing for more flexibility in presenting the results.
